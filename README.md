is a newer, more potent form of Brimstone. Its quality is so atrocious that it gets universally hated by every Chud. Sometimes, certain examples of Antimatter can't even be named due to how ugly and terrible it is. Another sign that it is Antimatter is if jannies hate it and it gets banned, but this also happens with higher quality posts.

Nothing can transform into antimatter, it can only be created. It's impossible to make antimatter of an existing variant. Instead, it is more feasible to create an antimatter variant, which is what the entire Poopson saga was about.

In a study on death row inmates[1], soychologists found that creators of Antimatter (referred to as Supernigrum Lapis Improbus within the study) tested high in psychopathic traits, roughly the same as murderers, and cases of schizophrenia occurred 2000% more often than within the general death row population.
